Caramelo is a large male dog, born around 2012. He was given away by his owners because they spent many hours outside and the dog barked a lot. Neighbors began to complain. It's important to note that they've had Caramel since he was a baby! Initially, they left the dog "temporarily" until they found a solution... as always happens, the "temporary" became "definitive". Caramel is a very shy dog. It takes time and patience for him to trust people. However, he is a sweet and playful dog, sociable with all other dogs. He knows how to walk on a leash. He will be delivered vaccinated, dewormed and sterilized.
