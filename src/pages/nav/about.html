          <h1>OUR HISTORY</h1>
          <p>
            Our journey began with a deep passion for animal welfare and a
            realization of the immense potential that technology holds in
            transforming the adoption process. Established in 2014, our pet
            adoption website has since grown into a trusted and reliable platform,
            connecting countless pets with their perfect families. Over the years,
            we have partnered with shelters, rescue organizations, and dedicated
            volunteers who share our commitment to saving lives and promoting
            responsible pet adoption. Our history is one of continuous learning,
            innovation, and growth, guided by the collective belief that every
            adoption has the power to change lives and bring lasting happiness for
            both pets and their human companions.

              <li>Teaching a pet how to seat</li>

                <li>Start with your pet standing in front of you.</li>
                <li>Hold a treat close to the pet's nose.</li>
                <li>Slowly move your hand with the treat upwards, over the pet's nose.</li>
                <li>As the pet follows the movement of the treat with its eyes, it will naturally end up sitting.</li>
                <li>Once the pet is fully seated, praise it and give the treat as a reward.</li>
                <li>Repeat these steps regularly until the pet learns to sit with just the verbal command.</li>
              </ol>
              <li>Teaching the pet to give its paw</li>
              <ol>
                <li>Start with the pet sitting in front of you.</li>
                <li>Hold a treat in your hand and show it to the dog.</li>
                <li>Slowly move your hand with the treat towards the pet's front paw.</li>
                <li>Say the command "Give paw" while lightly touching the pet's paw.</li>
                <li>Once the pet lifts its paw, gently hold it and give the treat as a reward.</li>
                <li>Repeat these steps regularly until the pet learns to give its paw with just the verbal command.</li>
