Kika lived in a house, but her owner got sick and could no longer maintain her. In her old home Kika lived a quiet life, so coming to a shelter with 700 dogs was a shock for her - too much noise and too little attention. Just take her for a walk outside the shelter and we see a difference in her behavior - Kika doesn't like being in the shelter and needs a home. She is the sweetest thing imaginable, sweet and kissable, she trusts people and seeks their protection. She is a wonderful and loving girl. She can easily live with other dogs: two, three or four - but not 700. She walks well on a leash. She was born in February 2016. She will be delivered vaccinated, dewormed and sterilized.
