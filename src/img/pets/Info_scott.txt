Scott is a male dog, large size, born +/- in 2013. He was delivered by the owners themselves because they spent many hours outside the house and the dog barked a lot. Neighbors began to complain. Notice that they had the dog since they were babies! Initially they left the dog "temporarily" until they found a solution.... as always happens, the "temporary" became "definitive". Scott is very shy. It takes time and patience for him to trust people. However, he is a sweet, playful dog, sociable with all dogs. He knows how to walk on a leash. He will be delivered vaccinated, dewormed and sterilized.
